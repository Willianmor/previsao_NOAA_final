**** More Details about the forecast **************************************

The Global Forecast System (GFS) is a global numerical weather prediction
computer model run by NOAA/NCEP/EMC.

The forecasts presented here are the GFS Ensemble Forecasts. Bias Corrected

Every day the week-1 and week-2 GFS precipitation ensemble forecasts have been
corrected with the past N days mean forecast errors, defined as follows: 

Bias1 = 1/N SUM [ Pf (week1) - Po (week1) ] (1) 
Bias2 = 1/N SUM [ Pf (week2) - Po (week2) ] (2) 

where Pf is the NCEP GFS ensemble week-1 and week-2 precipitation forecasts,
Po is the observed week-1and week-2 precipitation from CPC daily US and Global
Unified Precipitation Analysis. N is number of days (e.g. 30 or 7 days). The
choice of N is somewhat subjective. In general, the mean forecast errors
calculated from larger N (e.g. 30 days) are more robust than those from the
smaller N (e.g. 7 days or 1 day).
